# BU-EC504-Project
### Spring 2022

A major component of EC504 is the final project.

The goal of this project is to search large texts for the occurrences of specific patterns. 
This is done via the Aho-Corasick algorithm.

This implementation is extended to search for patterns that can have variations in capitalization, plus the use of wild cards that can substitute for any letter.
